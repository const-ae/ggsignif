Description: Enrich your 'ggplots' with group-wise comparisons.
    This package provides an easy way to indicate if two groups are
    significantly different. Commonly this is shown by a bracket on top
    connecting the groups of interest which itself is annotated with the
    level of significance (NS, *, **, ***).  The package provides a single
    layer (geom_signif()) that takes the groups for comparison and the
    test (t.test(), wilcox.text() etc.) as arguments and adds the
    annotation to the plot.
