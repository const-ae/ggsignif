Description: Enrich your 'ggplots' with group-wise comparisons.
  This package provides an easy way to indicate if two groups are significantly different.
  Commonly this is shown by a bracket on top connecting the groups of interest which itself is annotated with the level of significance (NS, *, **, ***).
  The package provides a single layer (geom_signif()) that takes the groups for comparison and the test (t.test(), wilcox.text() etc.) as arguments and adds the annotation
  to the plot.
